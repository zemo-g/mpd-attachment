# MPD Current-Attachment Program

Working repo for the program defined in `program.md`: the deliverable is a
*current-attachment predictor*; the analytic scaling relations are the
baseline to beat. Validation target is the Princeton Benchmark Thruster
(PBT). Solver work lands in Rail; source papers live in `refs/`.

## Status

- **Phase 0 - scoreboard: DONE.** `out/measured_ct.csv`, 244 rows of
  measured C_T(J, mdot, propellant) with self-assigned error bars, from two
  sources (see `data/README.md` for provenance and caveats):
  - Choueiri & Ziemer JPP-2001 Table 2 thrust fits, sampled inside their
    valid ranges: argon 1/3/6 g/s, xenon 3/6 g/s
  - digitized IEPC-97-121 fig 1 points (Gilland argon 3/6 g/s), which carry
    the deep low-current C_T rise the database years don't reach
- **Phase 1 - the bar: DONE.** `out/phase1_residuals.csv` + printed summary.
  Numbers to beat (C_T rms per series): Maecker 0.38-1.24; xi relation
  0.09-0.26 on the database range, **1.19 on low-current fig-1 argon 3 g/s**
  (max residual 4.9 at xi = 0.26, over-predicting the rise). That low-xi
  window is where a solver has room to be interesting.
- Phase 2 (solver, attachment prescribed): not started.

## Run

```bash
cd ~/projects/mpd-attachment
RAIL=~/projects/rail/rail_native
$RAIL run rail/phase0_scoreboard.rail --out-prefix /tmp/rail_mpd0
$RAIL run rail/phase1_baselines.rail  --out-prefix /tmp/rail_mpd1
$RAIL run rail/selftest.rail          --out-prefix /tmp/rail_mpdt   # expect SELFTEST PASS
```

Regenerate the digitized points (needs poppler + py311 PIL/numpy):
`/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11 tools/digitize_fig1.py`

## Corrections vs `program.md` (verified against the papers)

1. **The Choueiri relation has xi^2 INSIDE the log**: eq 36/37/39 of
   IEPC-97-121 read `C_T = nu/xi^4 + ln(ra/rc + xi^2)`, not
   `... + ln(ra/rc) + xi^2`. Outside-the-log over-predicts every
   high-current point by ~0.7; inside matches to rms ~0.1-0.26.
2. **Argon mass flows**: the JPP-2001 database measured 1/3/6 g/s (not
   1.5/3/6; the 1.5 g/s series is Gilland-1988 and only exists in
   IEPC-97-121 fig 7, undigitized so far). Xenon gained a 3 g/s series.
3. **Measured low-current slope is ~J^-1.3** over xi < 0.6 on the digitized
   fig-1 points, not the J^(-3..-4) the doc (and the paper's text) quote.
   The steep exponent may only hold below the lowest digitized point, or
   the claim is about the model's asymptote, not data. Standing finding.

## Layout

- `program.md` - the program doc (verbatim copy of the Desktop original)
- `refs/` - source PDFs (IEPC-97-121, JPP-2001 database paper)
- `data/` - digitized points + provenance notes (`data/README.md`)
- `rail/pbt.rail` - PBT geometry, constants, Table 2 fits, baselines
- `rail/phase0_scoreboard.rail` / `rail/phase1_baselines.rail` - runners
- `rail/selftest.rail` - 12 transcription/data/scoreboard guards
- `out/` - generated CSVs (rebuilt by the runners)
